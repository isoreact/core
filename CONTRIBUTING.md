# Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome, but please bear in mind this is a side
project and I will attend to these when I get time.

Guidelines for pull requests:

* Don't refactor everything.
* Don't make your PR bigger (or smaller) than it needs to be.
* Don't make test coverage worse.
* Don't update the package version number.
* Don't update any build artifacts.
* Don't rewrite history before the PR has been approved for merging.
* However, after your PR is accepted, it must be squashed and rebased against
  `develop` if it is not already exactly one commit ahead.

Please keep all communication on-topic and professional.
